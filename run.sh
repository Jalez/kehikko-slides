# What a host runs to start this module: no arguments, foreground, `exec`.
#
#   - No arguments, because a registration names a directory and this script,
#     never a command line a host would hand to a shell.
#   - No port here. It is PREFERRED_PORT in manifest.ts, and `serves()` in
#     vite.config.ts acts on it: takes it when free, honours $PORT from a host,
#     and moves (rewriting the registration) when something else has it.
#   - `exec` in the foreground, so the pid a host holds is the one that stops it.
#
# It does not register. That is `bun run register`, a person's decision.

# Install when nothing is installed, AND whenever bun.lock or package.json is
# newer than the last install here, the same rule as the host's own run.sh. A
# pull that moves the protocol pin leaves the old package in node_modules, and
# a page that imports a name the old package does not have draws nothing.
# `--frozen-lockfile`, so a start installs exactly what bun.lock says and never
# rewrites it behind somebody's back. The stamp is written only after an
# install that succeeded.
